# Auto Aim mod for Minecraft forge
**Compatible Minecraft version: 1.12.**

This mod can provide you with auto aim feature when using a bow. 
Please notice that the mod is still in development and may contain many bugs. I developed it with Minecraft version 1.12.2, so it is not guaranteed that the mod will work well on other versions.

## How to use
1. Go to [Release page](<https://github.com/ykozxy/AutoAimBow/releases>) to download the latest version of the mod. 
2. Install the mod to your Minecraft. Make sure you have already installed forge. 
3. Press _H_ in the game to enable/disable the mod.
4. Go to configuration in mod menu to custom the mod. 

## Known bugs

* Sometimes the crosshair would shift between targets dramatically. 
* Poor performance in aiming moving mobs. 
* There are some differences between the actual trajectory or the arrow and the one calculated by the mod, causing the mod to fail to aim targets effectively in certain terrain (especially those with a lot of obstacles).
* ...

## TODO list

* Calculate the motion of player and targeted entity to improve the accuracy of aiming. 
* Only aim the mobs within the screen.
